1. use **styled-components** to enhance CSS for styling React component

It turns css into js files and makes maintenance a lot easier. So we don't have to hunt across different files to find the styling affecting a specific component.

```bash
npm install styled-components
```

2. use **redux** to manage data and components

```bash
npm install redux
```
[redux](https://redux.js.org/)

3. use **React-Redux**
React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.
```bash
npm install react-redux
```
[react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/quick-start)

4. use **redux-thunk** as the middleware for Redux
Thunks are the recommended middleware for basic Redux side effects logic, including complex synchronous logic that needs access to the store, and simple async logic like AJAX requests.
```bash
npm install redux-thunk
```
